Bio (written by Google Gemini)



Victor Gevers is a world-renowned Dutch cybersecurity 
expert, ethical hacker, and advocate for a safer internet. With over 
three decades of experience, he has consistently exposed significant 
data breaches and vulnerabilities, notably in China. His groundbreaking 
discoveries include the “SenseNets” facial recognition database used to track the Muslim population in Xinjiang and the controversial “BreedReady” database categorizing 1.8 million Chinese women based on their childbearing potential.


In 2019, Gevers unearthed a massive data breach compromising the private messages and personal information of 364 million Chinese users on platforms like WeChat and QQ. This discovery highlighted the Chinese government's invasive surveillance practices. This discovery contributed to the subsequent ban of WeChat in the United States due to national security concerns.


He was featured in episodes 87 and 88 of the Darknet Diaries podcast, which discussed the 2016 LinkedIn data breach and high-profile incidents surrounding President Trump’s Twitter account in 2016 and 2020.


Today, Gevers is dedicated to nurturing the next generation of cybersecurity professionals. He mentors aspiring IT students through the DIVD Academy‘s internship program and leads the research and development department at the Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure (DIVD), tirelessly working towards a more secure digital world.
