TLDR: My wife is leaving me (for a few months), and my midlife crisis is flaring up like a fever. So, I automatically start looking for things to occupy my mind.

To distract myself from the impending doom of loneliness, I’ve got Eminem’s new album “The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce)” on repeat. If anyone needs proof that the world or my generation is ending, this album is it.
