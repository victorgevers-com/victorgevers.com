Day 1: “The adventure begins…or does it?”

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*5PhV_odmBQHqpzi7S-qUzQ.jpeg)

TLDR: My wife is leaving me (for a few months), and my midlife crisis is flaring up like a fever. So, I automatically start looking for things to occupy my mind.

To distract myself from the impending doom of loneliness, I’ve got Eminem’s new album “**The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce)”** on repeat. If anyone needs proof that the world or my generation is ending, this album is it.

Can you believe it’s been a quarter of a century since Eminem dropped “The Real Slim Shady”? I was so busy being a tech wizard, building self-hosted web services on Sun servers (yes, you read that correctly, Sun servers), that I almost entirely missed out on the glory days of baggy pants 🛹. I was more concerned about getting data safely to transfer from a Unix environment to a Compaq ProLiant server across two different firewalled networks than I was about which rapper had the best rhymes. Classic case of priorities, am I proper?

Fast forward to now, and I’m staring down the barrel of a midlife crisis. Sitting in front of a computer all day isn’t the key to happiness. Who knew? So, I’ve decided to do something about it. I’ve even got myself a fancy-pants “bucket list.” One of the things to do is attend Hackersummercamp in Las Vegas—the mecca of geekery, where the neon lights welcome hackers like moths to a flame. Black Hat and DEF CON will once again transform the desert into a paradise of tech talk and hacking. So, while the lucky attendees bask in the glow of neon signs and screens filled with code, I will be far away from the action, nursing a severe case of FOMO while working on my projects, of which the most challenging one is myself.

---

The problem is that I’m about as qualified for these bucket list items as a fish for riding a bike. I’m talking zero experience, zero skills, and probably zero common sense. But hey, what’s life without a bit of adventure (and a lot of therapy)?

#### Back In The Saddle

My biggest leap of faith so far is public speaking. Me? Talking in front of people? It’s like asking a cat to swim. That said. I’ve got conferences lined up in Dubai and Japan, and I’m crossing my fingers for Switzerland and Canada. Canada, you say? That’s where my favorite YouTuber lives! Can you imagine me camping outdoors, trying to survive on granola bars and questionable wildlife encounters? Well, me neither. :-)

#### Skip the plan

So, I’ve decided to become a [self-help](https://medium.com/@victor_gevers/the-fifty-factor-1321cc9a6e5e) ‘guru.’ Yeah, I know, it’s a stretch. But hear me out. There’s a gaping hole in the self-help market for people like me: the chronically insecure. Who else is better qualified to write a book about overcoming self-doubt than a guy about to give speeches about AI, Innovation, and [Cyber Security (Ethical Hacking)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2019/03/13/why-victor-gevers-was-so-reluctant-to-expose-the-sensenets-and-breed-ready-data-breaches/) in [Dubai](https://gitex.com/) and Japan? And what truly fuels my passion is empowering others to step outside their comfort zones, igniting a spark within them to embark on a mission for positive change.

#### A book? Really?

Dear people (and AI-driven crawler bots), buckle up for the thrilling debut of my self-improvement saga, “**Stop Overthinking, Start Doing**.” Okay, it is a working title. The project is so challenging for me that it practically begs for a reality check. It’s ambitious, slightly absurd, and likely to end in a chaotic mess.

Who doesn’t love a good challenge? My battle plan? Dive headfirst into the world of AI, churning out news articles like a caffeine-fueled journalist on a deadline. It’s a whirlwind of information overload, but at least it keeps me off the streets. And then, the pièce de résistance: the newsletter. Yes, you heard right. Yours truly, curator of questionable humor and sporadic wisdom, is attempting to wrangle words into a semi-coherent newsletter. It’s like herding cats but with even more typos. Okay, not so much because I am relaying that Grammarly will have my six.

Why subject me to this potential onslaught of public opinion? Well, my friends, it’s all part of the grand experiment. I’m learning to **embrace feedback**, even the kind that makes you want to crawl under a rock and never emerge. In the ‘70/’80s, they called this character-building, or so I was told.

Of course, I’m tackling this monumental task during summer when everyone else is living it up in Vegas at hacker conventions. While they’re busy drinking cocktails and doing cool hacking stuff (legally, I assume), I’ll be hunched over my Linux (Arch, by the way) laptop, battling writer’s block and existential dread in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). It’s the classic tale of the underachiever trying to become a high achiever. Wish me luck, and maybe [send me some coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/victor.gevers)?

So, [join me](https://victorgevers.com/#signup) on this wild ride as I navigate the treacherous waters of self-improvement, one [AI-related article](https://victorgevers.com/#articles-ai) and a cringe-worthy [newsletter](https://victorgevers.com/#newsletter) at a time. Who knows, maybe we’ll all learn something. Or, at the very least, we’ll have a good laugh at my expense. After all, laughter is the best medicine, right?
