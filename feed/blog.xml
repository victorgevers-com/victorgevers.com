            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Week of Art in London Ends with a School of Piranhas</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/929/1*WZjL0Jq-MOcT0FgX8BkSYA.png" /><figcaption><a href="https://www.banksy.co.uk/">Banksy</a></figcaption></figure><p>For the seventh consecutive day, Londoners woke up to discover yet another artwork by the elusive British street artist <a href="https://www.banksy.co.uk/">Banksy.</a> This time, the mysterious artist has transformed a police watchhouse into an aquatic scene by painting a school of piranhas on its windows, sparking excitement and curiosity across the city.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/929/1*ueYMZp8mFRGlWbIWBj3Cbw.png" /><figcaption><a href="https://www.banksy.co.uk/">Banksy</a></figcaption></figure><p>The piranha artwork, which appeared overnight on a police post in Ludgate Hill, is the latest in a series of pieces that have captivated both locals and visitors in the British capital. Over the past week, Banksy has rolled out six other works, each featuring dark silhouettes of various animals, including a goat, elephants, monkeys, a wolf, pelicans, and a cat. However, the latest piece stands out with its vibrant use of colour, which makes the police booth look like an aquarium teeming with life.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1014/1*lsxqrLzniiSANOQCLASIhw.png" /><figcaption><a href="https://www.banksy.co.uk/">Banksy</a></figcaption></figure><p>“We are aware of criminal damage to a police post in Ludgate Hill,” said Chief Inspector Andy Spooner in a statement. The police are collaborating with the City of London Corporation, the owner of the watchhouse, to determine the best way to preserve the artwork. A spokesperson for the Corporation told BBC News that they are exploring options to ensure the piranha piece remains intact for public viewing.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1014/1*2G3N0I0mTTtvznRto8otqg.png" /></figure><p>The week-long artistic spree has gone with a couple of incidents. Two of Banksy’s new works have already disappeared. On Thursday, just an hour after it was revealed, the image of a wolf on a satellite dish was stolen. Then, on Saturday, contractors removed a cat painted on a dilapidated billboard, citing safety concerns. The rapid disappearance of these works has only added to the frenzy surrounding Banksy’s latest projects.</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fc9QV6Y69icM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dc9QV6Y69icM&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fc9QV6Y69icM%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/0ab4530aa0b4e95fc1b6554927818d5e/href">https://medium.com/media/0ab4530aa0b4e95fc1b6554927818d5e/href</a></iframe><p>Banksy’s decision to unveil a new piece every day this week has sparked widespread speculation about the meaning behind this flurry of creativity. Traditionally, the artist’s works appear sporadically, with months often passing between new pieces. The daily revelations have prompted fans and media outlets to theorize about the underlying message of the works.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/article/2024/aug/11/banksy-confirms-piranhas-seventh-animal-artwork-in-london">The Observer</a>, a British newspaper, the artworks may be intended to “cheer up the public” amid challenging times. However, Banksy’s representatives dismissed the more intricate theories, stating that many interpretations are “far too complicated.”</p><p>As the buzz continues, Londoners wonder what Banksy will do next. Whether the artist plans to continue this streak of daily unveilings or this piranha-filled watchhouse will mark the end of this week’s creative outburst remains to be seen. What is certain, though, is that Banksy’s ability to surprise and provoke thought is as strong as ever.</p><p>Is it art, or is it vandalism? That’s the million-dollar question, and everyone’s got an opinion. But hey, whether you call it art or a crime, Londoners are eating it up. We’re all hooked on this Banksy mystery tour and can’t wait to see what twist he throws at us next. Could this be the end of his art spree, or is he just getting started? Drop your theories in the comments — let’s get this debate going!</p><p>PS: <a href="https://blog.victorgevers.com/9-creative-habits-99615be92350">My personal blog post from earlier today</a> was about creativity in general. Is there a fine line between creative expression and breaking the rules? Banksy blurs those boundaries, and that’s part of what makes his work so captivating. What do you think? When does creativity cross over into something else? Let me know your thoughts!</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=abc602e7c4ac" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://blog.victorgevers.com/banksy-strikes-again-abc602e7c4ac">Banksy Strikes Again</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.victorgevers.com">Victor Gevers</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Day 7: <em>My nine habits to stay creative</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NHTTOaXCIV53wA1vKNTXyg.png" /><figcaption>Despicable Me 4</figcaption></figure><p><em>Date: August 11, 2024</em></p><p>Last night, I enjoyed the fourth instalment of the Despicable Me franchise. It made me ponder the impressive feat the creators pulled off — how do you maintain humour, freshness, and novelty in a series that&#39;s already spanned three successful movies? You expect to find my review soon after I watch it again. To make an excellent review. ;-)</p><p>An old colleague recently messaged me on WhatsApp asking about my writing process and how much I rely on an LLM. It&#39;s a valid question, so I took the time to explain my workflow and the <a href="https://blog.victorgevers.com/the-hottest-challenge-of-the-summer-525481622f1e">personal challenge</a> I&#39;ve set for myself.</p><p>Creativity is a superpower; whether I am doodling in <a href="https://excalidraw.com/">Excalidraw</a>, scratching things in a paper notebook, hacking, blurting random thoughts to my voice memo recorder or writing my daily blog, I must put all my energy into this creative process.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/745/1*VDZAKmu1U1TUUx_F7Jl5uw.png" /><figcaption><a href="https://www.effinbirds.com/collections/vendors?q=EFFIN%20BIRDS">EFFIN BIRDS</a></figcaption></figure><p>Even the most brilliant minds need a little tune-up every now and then. I&#39;ve spent over <strong>40 years</strong> juggling projects, wrangling teams, and dodging office politics, and trust me, I&#39;ve seen it all. So, if you feel like your creative spark is fizzling out faster than a cheap bottle of champagne, I&#39;ve got your back. Here are my nine habits that&#39;ll keep those ideas flowing, even when you&#39;re tempted to binge-watch Netflix and call it a day (no judgment here; we&#39;ve all been there).</p><p><strong>Let&#39;s dive in</strong> — just like you dive into that bag of chips when you&#39;re supposed to be on a diet. Not me, because I&#39;m still holding strong with my Keto diet!</p><h4><strong>Take Care of Your Body</strong></h4><p>Remember when you tried to pull an all-nighter fueled by coffee and sheer willpower? Yeah, your brain probably felt like it was running on fumes. Creativity doesn&#39;t thrive on caffeine and sleepless nights. So, do yourself a favour and get some decent shut-eye. You could even walk around the block or to the fridge. Your brain and your waistline will thank you.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*eWxs6CNDFtOavCbQ5yQnvw.png" /></figure><p>My <a href="https://medium.com/@victor_gevers/the-fifty-factor-1321cc9a6e5e">daily routine</a> involves maintaining a minimum number of steps and standing hours (no sitting allowed!), which I need to achieve consistently, along with a regular exercise regimen. However, I also have a personal goal to dedicate a certain amount of time to writing each day. In the past two weeks, as I&#39;ve increased my focus on writing, I&#39;ve found it increasingly challenging to balance this with my fitness goals, and I have yet to reach my daily step and standing targets. It&#39;s a juggling act, but I&#39;m determined to find a way to prioritize both my physical well-being and my creative pursuits.</p><h4><strong>Give your Brain a Break</strong></h4><p>Ever notice how your best ideas hit you when you&#39;re in the shower or zoning out on a long drive? That&#39;s your brain taking a much-needed vacation. Think of it like a high-strung racehorse — it needs time to graze in the pasture, not just run laps around the track. So, give your brain some downtime. Watch a silly movie, daydream, or stare out the window. The more random and ridiculous, the better.</p><h4><strong>Don&#39;t Wait for Inspiration</strong></h4><p>Waiting for inspiration is like waiting for a unicorn to appear at your doorstep — it&#39;s probably not happening. Inspiration doesn&#39;t just magically appear out of thin air (unless you&#39;re struck by lightning, in which case, seek medical attention). Go out there and find it! Scroll through Instagram or Pinterest (but don&#39;t fall the rabbit hole of doom scrolling), visit a flea market, or people-watch at a mall or near a tourist attraction. Inspiration is lurking everywhere; you have to open your eyes and ears.<strong> It&#39;s not coming, So get it.</strong></p><h4><strong>Hoard Visuals Like It&#39;s Black Friday</strong></h4><p>You&#39;re on the right track if your Pinterest boards are overflowing and your phone is full of screenshots. Collect those visuals like they&#39;re going out of style. Magazine clippings, random doodles, even that weird meme your friend sent you — save it all. When you&#39;re stuck, flip through your collection and see what sparks an idea. It&#39;s like a treasure hunt for your brain. I am downloading many images from websites with visuals that I like or might like in the future. For this, I have a web browser plugin named <a href="https://webextension.org/listing/save-images.html">Save Images</a>.</p><h4><strong>Play and Experiment</strong></h4><p>Not everything you create has to be a masterpiece. Sometimes, it&#39;s okay to make stuff for the sheer joy of it, even if it&#39;s wholly nonsensical or downright goofy. Try a new art style, write a ridiculous song, or learn a TikTok dance (bonus points if you film it and laugh at yourself later). No one has to see it, so there&#39;s no pressure. Remember, some of the best ideas start as silly experiments. <strong>Have fun without a care in the world.</strong></p><h4><strong>Have a Side Hobby</strong></h4><p>Don&#39;t limit yourself to just one creative outlet. If you&#39;re a painter, try writing poetry. If you&#39;re a musician, dabble in photography. If you&#39;re in IT, you have more side projects than anyone else. Start repurposing those Raspberry PIs that are collecting dust and give them a new purpose for someone else.</p><p>Having multiple hobbies is like cross-training for your brain. Plus, you might discover a hidden talent you never knew you had (like when you accidentally baked a cake that didn&#39;t taste like cardboard).</p><h4><strong>Don&#39;t Sweat the Small Stuff</strong></h4><p>Perfectionism is the enemy of progress. If you spend all your time obsessing over every tiny detail, you&#39;ll need more time to finish something. Aim for &quot;good enough&quot; and move on. Trust me, no one will notice that one pixel is slightly out of place. Done is better than perfect — ask any student who&#39;s ever pulled an all-nighter to finish a paper. <strong>Perfection is overrated</strong>.</p><h4><strong>Be a Lifelong Student</strong></h4><p>Learning continues even after you graduate. The moment you stop learning is the moment you start stagnating. So, keep feeding your brain with new information. Take online courses, watch YouTube tutorials, or ask a friend to teach you something cool. And once you&#39;ve learned something, share it with others! Teaching is a great way to solidify your knowledge and inspire others.</p><h4><strong>Embrace the Change</strong></h4><p>Change is inevitable, whether we like it or not. You can either resist it or embrace it. When things change — your style, your interests, even your surroundings — use it as an opportunity for growth. Who knows? That change might lead to your next big breakthrough. Remember, even your favourite celebrities had to reinvent themselves to stay relevant. <a href="https://medium.com/victor-gevers/ctrl-alt-delete-your-fears-81409633380a"><strong>Do it even if it is scary</strong></a>.</p><p>So, there you have it — My nine habits I am trying to fulfil that keep my creativity flowing like a fine wine (or a cheap beer, depending on your preference). Whether you&#39;re an aspiring artist, a budding entrepreneur, or someone who loves to create, these tips will help you stay inspired and keep those ideas coming.</p><p><strong>Thanks for reading!</strong> If you want more creative insights and occasional doses of humour, follow me at <a href="https://victorgevers.com/">victorgevers.com</a>. And don&#39;t forget to share your creative habits in the comments — because we&#39;re all in this crazy, beautiful mess together.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Day 6: </strong><em>Lessons from the trenches on mistakes, mishaps, and making IT work.</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OVTfDguAjG3_n9gu3BWklQ.jpeg" /><figcaption><a href="https://www.freepik.com/free-ai-image/3d-cartoon-latin-american-village-scenery_231538027.htm">Image by freepik</a></figcaption></figure><p><em>Date: August 10, 2024</em></p><h3>Leaving a Jet Plane</h3><p>The Hague&#39;s 5:00 AM darkness enveloped us as we hopped into a Tesla taxi, its quiet hum starkly contrasting the anticipation buzzing within me. The city lights blurred past, replaced by the soft glow of the rising sun as we neared Schiphol airport. A bittersweet goodbye at the security gate marked the <a href="https://medium.com/victor-gevers/the-hottest-challenge-of-the-summer-525481622f1e">start of my wife&#39;s Colombian adventure and my solo journey back home</a>.</p><p>The train&#39;s swift passage through the Schiphol tunnel, a momentary pop in my ears, ushered in the 7:00 AM sunlight. The Hague-bound journey began, tinged with the unique melancholy of travelling alone, amplified by the prospect of an empty house. To combat the creeping loneliness, I turned to my to-do list, a lifeline of tasks to anchor my thoughts: publish my AI newsletter (<a href="https://victorgevers.substack.com/p/ai-weekly-32">AI Weekly</a> <a href="https://victorgevers.substack.com/p/ai-weekly-32">#32</a>), write a personal blog post (this one), tackle household chores, and delve into planned research.</p><p>Yesterday&#39;s musings on preparedness paved the way for today&#39;s reflection on learning from mistakes. As a solo journey can be daunting, so can confronting our missteps. However, within those errors lies the growth potential, a chance to recalibrate and emerge stronger.</p><p>As I navigate this day alone, I&#39;m reminded that there&#39;s always an opportunity to learn, adapt, and ultimately thrive, even in the face of challenges.</p><h4>Buckle up Buttercup</h4><p>So, yeah, I&#39;ve got this whole IT background thing going on. If it beeps, blinks, or boots up, I will make IT perform. They&#39;re like my loyal, slightly neurotic pets as long as they compute.</p><p>So you might have heard this joke that echoes through the hallowed halls of IT departments and software development teams: &quot;You&#39;re not a <em>real</em> IT engineer until you&#39;ve accidentally <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14476421">deleted the entire production database</a>. Google for it, and you will find many examples of this. Or maybe you&#39;re the legendary developer who <a href="https://archive.ph/lXqkq">single-handedly shut down every Windows machine on the planet with a software update</a> that was supposed to <em>protect</em> them.&quot; ;-)</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;schema=twitter&amp;url=https%3A//x.com/CrowdStrike/status/1815131118300966933&amp;image=" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/7387b26441234936bd9e3563320540d1/href">https://medium.com/media/7387b26441234936bd9e3563320540d1/href</a></iframe><p>Okay, let&#39;s all take a collective sigh of relief and hope that those tech horror stories remain firmly in the realm of urban legends. But behind every IT professional&#39;s nervous laughter hides a universal truth: In the ever-evolving, sometimes chaotic world of IT and software development, success isn&#39;t about having all the answers. It&#39;s about navigating the inevitable faceplants, the &quot;oops&quot; moments, and emerging on the other side, not just unscathed but stronger. Do you know how tech folks joke about managers climbing the ladder through sheer charisma and minimal competence? Well, guess what? Engineers have their version of that climb, and it&#39;s paved with countless lines of buggy code and the occasional server meltdown.</p><h4><strong>Bootcamp of Blunders</strong></h4><p>You can devour every blog post, podcast, and programming manual ever written, but there&#39;s no substitute for the baptism by fire that is real-world experience. It&#39;s like learning to rumba dance or juggle flaming torches. You can watch countless YouTube tutorials and practice in your living room, but you will truly understand the rhythm and heat once you step onto that dance floor or into the circus ring.</p><p>In the tech world, this translates to making mistakes — and lots of them. It means spending sleepless nights crafting what you believe is a flawless piece of code, only to realize later that it looks more like abstract art than a functional program. It means confidently implementing the &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle">Single Responsibility Principle</a>,&quot; only to discover you&#39;ve turned your codebase into a tangled mess worthy of a Gordon Ramsay meltdown. Back in my GitHub newbie days, I had a few <em>facepalm</em> moments. For example, I accidentally pushed sensitive information straight to the repo at that time. I ended up having to nuke the whole thing, losing precious history, code changes, and even scrambling to change credentials. You know. The thing I warn others not to do. :-)</p><h3>Victor Gevers on X (formerly Twitter): &quot;Huawei ♥️ Splunk but is 😕 about Github. The best company secrets from China always end on Github (or Gitlab). A part of that problem is caused by the 996 working hour system. People under pressure make more mistakes. They will continue making those if this does not change. :-) pic.twitter.com/9nQFtQBeUU / X&quot;</h3><p>Huawei ♥️ Splunk but is 😕 about Github. The best company secrets from China always end on Github (or Gitlab). A part of that problem is caused by the 996 working hour system. People under pressure make more mistakes. They will continue making those if this does not change.</p><h4><strong>From Facepalm to High-Five</strong></h4><p>But here&#39;s the twist: Every error, every bug, every poorly designed system, or every misconfiguration is a golden ticket to the school of hard knocks. It&#39;s a chance to gain experience, refine your understanding, and develop that gut instinct that separates the tech wizards from the mere mortals.</p><p>Think of it this way: Every time you metaphorically shoot yourself in the foot, you&#39;re not just adding another scar to your collection. You&#39;re also gaining invaluable intel on where <em>not</em> to aim next time. And before you know it, you&#39;re not just limping along; you&#39;re doing the cha-cha slide confidently. <em>Please do not shoot yourself in the foot.</em></p><h4><strong>Where Good Ideas Meet Reality</strong></h4><p>The world of software and IT is a peculiar place where brilliant ideas are abundant and elusive. You can learn about cutting-edge design patterns, memorize the most efficient algorithms, and become a walking encyclopedia of best practices. But does translating those concepts into code work? That&#39;s where the magic — and the mayhem — happens. It&#39;s like being handed a treasure map with cryptic clues and no GPS. You know there&#39;s gold out there somewhere, but navigating the treacherous terrain, deciphering the riddles, and digging in the right spot requires a blend of experience, skill, a dash of luck, and probably a few wrong turns and dead ends.</p><h4><strong>Turning Mistakes into Milestones</strong></h4><p>So, whether you&#39;re a fresh-faced intern or a seasoned IT veteran, don&#39;t let your mistakes get you down. Embrace them like a long-lost friend. Learn from them like a curious student. And remember, every time you trip over a hurdle, you&#39;re one step closer to becoming a master of your domain. After all, the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step… and probably a few stumbles, detours, and maybe even a faceplant. But installing, configuring, customizing, troubleshooting, and, most importantly, keep growing. Because every error message, every system crash, and every &quot;oops&quot; moment is just another beat in the symphony of your tech career. And before you know it, you&#39;ll be conducting the whole orchestra (GarageBand does not count).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FABth1-FMwpgNYIu4qVvDA.jpeg" /></figure><h3>My Deadpool &amp; Wolverine ‘review’</h3><p>Hey everyone,</p><p>I just returned from watching “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6263850/">Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</a>,” and I have much to share. As a long-time Marvel fan, I’ve eagerly anticipated this movie, especially after the lackluster performances of “The Marvels” and “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.” Thankfully, this film delivered in ways that those did not, but it also left me with mixed feelings.</p><h4>Marvel’s Big Comeback</h4><p>Still reeling from a couple of major box office disappointments, Marvel Studios decided to bring out the big guns. And by big guns, I mean the foul-mouthed Deadpool and the hard-drinking Wolverine. This gamble paid off spectacularly, with the movie expected to rake in around $425 million globally within just a few days of its release. This sets a new record for R-rated openings and reignites hope for Marvel’s future.</p><h4>Plot and Execution</h4><p>The film is directed by Shawn Levy and picks up after the events of “Deadpool,” “Deadpool 2,” and “Logan.” The plot involves Deadpool (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds">Ryan Reynolds</a>) hijacking Time Variance Authority tech to bring back Wolverine (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Jackman">Hugh Jackman</a>) to save their universe from a new threat, Mr. Paradox, played by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Macfadyen">Matthew Macfadyen</a>. The story is as convoluted as you’d expect from a Marvel film these days, with terms like “sacred timeline” and “metaphysical graveyard” being thrown around.</p><p>Despite the complexity, the movie is a love letter to Marvel fans. It is jam-packed with “<em>oh no, they didn’t” </em>cameos, action-packed sequences, and the kind of humor that only Deadpool can deliver. It’s fun, irreverent, and exactly what you’d want from a Deadpool Wolverine team-up.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*bINv2Z3svqfg5otny7ZLgA.jpeg" /></figure><h4>The Cynical Undertone</h4><p>However, amid all the fan service and spectacle, there’s a noticeable shift in tone. Disney’s influence is creeping into what used to be Marvel’s most outrageous corner.</p><blockquote>The movie is packed with jokes about “being canceled by the woke mob” and Gen Z’s “trauma-dumping,” which felt less like Deadpool’s usual edgy humor and more like pandering to a specific audience.</blockquote><p>The absence of sex and a reduction in dirty jokes, which were staples in the previous Deadpool films, also stood out. While the movie still has plenty of violence and cursing, it seems Disney is steering Deadpool towards a more conservative path, possibly to placate fans who were upset with the direction of the recent Star Wars trilogy and other Marvel films.</p><h4>Final Thoughts</h4><p>“Deadpool &amp; Wolverine” is undeniably entertaining and a significant win for Marvel. It’s a thrilling ride that showcases the best of both characters and brings much-needed excitement back to the MCU. However, the underlying cynicism and shift in tone indicate that even Deadpool isn’t immune to Disney’s overarching control.</p><p>This movie is a must-watch for die-hard Marvel fans. Just be prepared for a slightly toned-down and more mainstream-friendly Deadpool.</p><blockquote>Until next time, keep your chimichangas warm and your claws sharp!</blockquote><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=f8970435ba06" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://blog.victorgevers.com/my-deadpool-wolverine-review-f8970435ba06">My Deadpool &amp; Wolverine ‘review’</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.victorgevers.com">Victor Gevers</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>You damn right it’s limited. No cup holder, no back seat.</em></p><p>Bad Boys: Ride or Die, the latest installment in the long-running buddy cop franchise, delivers a mixed bag of high-octane action, humor, and nostalgia that will likely divide audiences. Directed by Bilall Fallah and Adil El Arbi, the film stars Will Smith and Martin Lawrence reprising their roles as Miami detectives Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*whEdXypJ2eQY-N_v76DoQw.png" /></figure><p>On the positive side, many critics praised the film for staying true to its roots. The chemistry between Smith and Lawrence remains a highlight, with their comedic banter and dynamic energy bringing much-needed life to the movie. The action sequences are described as thrilling and visually impressive, keeping the audience engaged with explosive mayhem and high-stakes chases. For fans of the franchise, “Ride or Die” offers plenty of callbacks and familiar elements, making it a fun and entertaining ride that doesn’t take itself too seriously.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pjHzpDMO8XwWL5IXmkOy5Q.png" /><figcaption>“Trust the universe.”</figcaption></figure><p>However, not all reviews were glowing. Some critics found the film’s reliance on nostalgia and formulaic plot to be a drawback. The screenplay was criticized for being disjointed and predictable, with humor that occasionally falls flat. While the action scenes are abundant, they sometimes feel repetitive and lack the innovative spark that characterized earlier entries in the series. Additionally, a few reviewers felt that the film’s attempt to balance frenetic action with more serious, introspective moments resulted in a tonal mess.</p><p>Despite these criticisms, “Bad Boys: Ride or Die” manages to offer enough entertainment to satisfy fans of the series. The movie knows its audience and delivers what they expect: a blend of humor, action, and the charismatic duo of Smith and Lawrence. While it may not reinvent the wheel, it provides a fun, popcorn-worthy experience that is perfect for a summer blockbuster.</p><p>It’s a film that thrives on the enduring charm of its leads and the thrill of its action, even if it struggles to break new ground. If you’re a franchise fan, this latest installment will likely be an enjoyable addition to the “Bad Boys” legacy.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FZDB5Y9TIWkMvejWNRRcPA.jpeg" /></figure><p>Thank you for sticking to the end credits. Did you enjoy <a href="https://medium.com/@victor_gevers/my-deadpool-wolverine-review-f8970435ba06">Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</a> as much as I did?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Day 1: “The adventure begins…or does it?”</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5PhV_odmBQHqpzi7S-qUzQ.jpeg" /></figure><p>TLDR: My wife is leaving me (for a few months), and my midlife crisis is flaring up like a fever. So, I automatically start looking for things to occupy my mind.</p><p>To distract myself from the impending doom of loneliness, I’ve got Eminem’s new album “<strong>The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce)”</strong> on repeat. If anyone needs proof that the world or my generation is ending, this album is it.</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F22tVWwmTie8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D22tVWwmTie8&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F22tVWwmTie8%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/ca087454db4b775616f015adb8599876/href">https://medium.com/media/ca087454db4b775616f015adb8599876/href</a></iframe><p>Can you believe it’s been a quarter of a century since Eminem dropped “The Real Slim Shady”? I was so busy being a tech wizard, building self-hosted web services on Sun servers (yes, you read that correctly, Sun servers), that I almost entirely missed out on the glory days of baggy pants 🛹. I was more concerned about getting data safely to transfer from a Unix environment to a Compaq ProLiant server across two different firewalled networks than I was about which rapper had the best rhymes. Classic case of priorities, am I proper?</p><p>Fast forward to now, and I’m staring down the barrel of a midlife crisis. Sitting in front of a computer all day isn’t the key to happiness. Who knew? So, I’ve decided to do something about it. I’ve even got myself a fancy-pants “bucket list.” One of the things to do is attend Hackersummercamp in Las Vegas—the mecca of geekery, where the neon lights welcome hackers like moths to a flame. Black Hat and DEF CON will once again transform the desert into a paradise of tech talk and hacking. So, while the lucky attendees bask in the glow of neon signs and screens filled with code, I will be far away from the action, nursing a severe case of FOMO while working on my projects, of which the most challenging one is myself.</p><p>The problem is that I’m about as qualified for these bucket list items as a fish for riding a bike. I’m talking zero experience, zero skills, and probably zero common sense. But hey, what’s life without a bit of adventure (and a lot of therapy)?</p><h4>Back In The Saddle</h4><p>My biggest leap of faith so far is public speaking. Me? Talking in front of people? It’s like asking a cat to swim. That said. I’ve got conferences lined up in Dubai and Japan, and I’m crossing my fingers for Switzerland and Canada. Canada, you say? That’s where my favorite YouTuber lives! Can you imagine me camping outdoors, trying to survive on granola bars and questionable wildlife encounters? Well, me neither. :-)</p><h4>Skip the plan</h4><p>So, I’ve decided to become a <a href="https://medium.com/@victor_gevers/the-fifty-factor-1321cc9a6e5e">self-help</a> ‘guru.’ Yeah, I know, it’s a stretch. But hear me out. There’s a gaping hole in the self-help market for people like me: the chronically insecure. Who else is better qualified to write a book about overcoming self-doubt than a guy about to give speeches about AI, Innovation, and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2019/03/13/why-victor-gevers-was-so-reluctant-to-expose-the-sensenets-and-breed-ready-data-breaches/">Cyber Security (Ethical Hacking)</a> in <a href="https://gitex.com/">Dubai</a> and Japan? And what truly fuels my passion is empowering others to step outside their comfort zones, igniting a spark within them to embark on a mission for positive change.</p><h4>A book? Really?</h4><p>Dear people (and AI-driven crawler bots), buckle up for the thrilling debut of my self-improvement saga, “<strong>Stop Overthinking, Start Doing</strong>.” Okay, it is a working title. The project is so challenging for me that it practically begs for a reality check. It’s ambitious, slightly absurd, and likely to end in a chaotic mess.</p><p>Who doesn’t love a good challenge? My battle plan? Dive headfirst into the world of AI, churning out news articles like a caffeine-fueled journalist on a deadline. It’s a whirlwind of information overload, but at least it keeps me off the streets. And then, the pièce de résistance: the newsletter. Yes, you heard right. Yours truly, curator of questionable humor and sporadic wisdom, is attempting to wrangle words into a semi-coherent newsletter. It’s like herding cats but with even more typos. Okay, not so much because I am relaying that Grammarly will have my six.</p><p>Why subject me to this potential onslaught of public opinion? Well, my friends, it’s all part of the grand experiment. I’m learning to <strong>embrace feedback</strong>, even the kind that makes you want to crawl under a rock and never emerge. In the ‘70/’80s, they called this character-building, or so I was told.</p><p>Of course, I’m tackling this monumental task during summer when everyone else is living it up in Vegas at hacker conventions. While they’re busy drinking cocktails and doing cool hacking stuff (legally, I assume), I’ll be hunched over my Linux (Arch, by the way) laptop, battling writer’s block and existential dread in <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>. It’s the classic tale of the underachiever trying to become a high achiever. Wish me luck, and maybe <a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/victor.gevers">send me some coffee</a>?</p><p>So, <a href="https://victorgevers.com/#signup">join me</a> on this wild ride as I navigate the treacherous waters of self-improvement, one <a href="https://victorgevers.com/#articles-ai">AI-related article</a> and a cringe-worthy <a href="https://victorgevers.com/#newsletter">newsletter</a> at a time. Who knows, maybe we’ll all learn something. Or, at the very least, we’ll have a good laugh at my expense. After all, laughter is the best medicine, right?</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Gd50J4NYtFEasBpyYSxNRA.jpeg" /></figure><blockquote>here are two mistakes one can make along the road to the truth . . . not going all the way and not starting. — Buddha (possible)</blockquote><p><em>To be continued...</em></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=525481622f1e" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://blog.victorgevers.com/the-hottest-challenge-of-the-summer-525481622f1e">The hottest challenge of the summer</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.victorgevers.com">Victor Gevers</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Day 2: A new adventure beckons?”</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SHJDzKE1NAEcjT0O1PqW7g.jpeg" /></figure><p><em>Tuesday, August 6th, 2024</em></p><h3>New adventure beckons</h3><p>A fantastic email landed in my inbox this morning! I’ve been invited to join Virtue, the Senior Ethical Council of <a href="https://thehackinggames.com/">the Hacking Games</a>. How cool is that? It’s a group of cybersecurity experts who guide the next generation of hackers towards ethical practices. It’s a mission I can definitely get behind, and the fact that they’re already working with some big names in the industry is even more inspiring. I love the idea of sharing my knowledge and experience to help young people make the right choices. And who knows, maybe I’ll even meet some of my cybersecurity heroes through this! I’ve already responded to let them know that I’m eager to join and help in any way I can. I’m particularly excited about possibly connecting The Hacking Games with the community and the next generation.</p><h3>Nurturing Tomorrow’s Hacking Heroes</h3><p>I often have the privilege of guiding eager IT students on their cyber adventures through the <a href="https://the.divd.academy/">DIVD Academy</a>’s internship program. It’s like a talent show for spotting the next generation of “cyber superheroes!” Through our volunteer initiative, we help these budding hackers channel their impressive skills (and sometimes mischievous curiosity) toward the forces of good. You wouldn’t believe some of the stories — from banking service to solar panels, these whiz kids have a knack for finding unexpected entrances. Luckily, we’re here to show them the noble path of ethical hacking, transforming potential mischief-makers into defenders of the digital realm. It’s a win-win: they keep their “superpowers,” and the world becomes safer. So this could be a really rewarding experience, both personally and professionally. I’m looking forward to seeing where it leads!</p><h3>A Chapter Closer to Sharing My Story</h3><p>Yesterday, I took a leap of faith and maybe a swig of liquid courage (coffee) and unleashed my first personal blog post upon the unsuspecting world. It’s called “<a href="https://medium.com/@victor_gevers/the-hottest-challenge-of-the-summer-525481622f1e">The hottest challenge of the summer</a>”, and let me tell you, hitting that “publish” button felt like jumping off a digital cliff without a parachute. But hey, no guts, no glory, right?</p><p>Now it’s out there, floating in the vast expanse of the internet like a message in a bottle. There’s no turning back now, only onward and upward (fingers crossed!). I hope I made the right decision, but even if I did, it’ll be memorable.</p><h3>The Hacker’s Dilemma: Ethics in the Digital Age</h3><p>About making the right decision. Today, I want to delve into a topic close to my heart — the ethical considerations that every hacker, myself included, grapples with. It’s a complex landscape where the lines between right and wrong can blur, and our decisions have far-reaching consequences.</p><p>I’ve always been fascinated by the possibilities of technology and the thrill of exploring its hidden depths. But with that power comes a great responsibility. As ethical hackers, we walk a tightrope, using our skills to expose vulnerabilities, not exploit them. We’re the guardians of the digital realm, ensuring that the systems we rely on are secure and resilient. This is one of the reasons why we co-founded the <a href="https://www.divd.nl/add">Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure</a> and the <a href="https://divd.academy/">DIVD Academy</a>.</p><p>But it’s not always easy. The temptation to cross the line, to use our knowledge for personal gain, is ever-present. Even when we act with the best intentions, our actions can be misconstrued and our motives questioned. I have been in a few situations where taking the right path was the hardest, having to deal with all kinds of backlash. This partly led to taking my work back out of the public domain and only showing what I could share on things that would not cause any politically motivated stir.</p><p>That’s why it’s so important to have a solid ethical compass. For me, it’s about more than just following the rules. It’s about upholding a <a href="https://divd.nl/code">code of conduct</a> that puts the greater good above all else. It’s about using my skills to protect the innocent, not harm them.</p><p>I’m not naive. I know that there are <a href="http://archive.is/2023.03.01-223711/https://www.ftm.nl/artikelen/ethisch-hacker-blijkt-dark-side">those</a> who use their hacking abilities for nefarious purposes. But I also believe that ethical hackers have a crucial role to play in the fight against cybercrime. We’re the ones who can level the playing field and expose vulnerabilities before they’re exploited.</p><p>So, what does it mean to be an ethical hacker? For me, it’s about upholding the following principles:</p><ul><li><strong>Respect for privacy:</strong> I will not invade the privacy of others without their consent.</li><li><strong>Responsibility:</strong> I will use my skills for good, not evil, to serve humankind.</li><li><strong>Integrity:</strong> I will be honest and transparent in my actions.</li><li><strong>Professionalism:</strong> I will maintain the highest standards of conduct.</li></ul><p>These principles guide me in everything I do, from (unannounced) penetration testing to vulnerability disclosure. They’re the foundation of my ethical hacking practice, and I believe they should be the foundation of any ethical hacker’s practice.</p><p>The digital world is complex and ever-changing. As ethical hackers, we are responsible for navigating this landscape with integrity and respect. We’re the guardians of the digital realm, and it’s up to us to ensure that it remains a safe and secure place for everyone.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=74abfd2bfda7" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://blog.victorgevers.com/let-the-games-begin-74abfd2bfda7">Let the Games begin</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.victorgevers.com">Victor Gevers</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Day 3: &quot;The Race Isn&#39;t Over Until It&#39;s Over&quot;</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*IIwva0MkE2KUxQf5" /></figure><p>It&#39;s now 00:53, and I&#39;m finally heading to bed. The day slipped away from me, and I didn&#39;t manage to write my daily blog post. Instead, I poured my energy into two articles that demanded my full attention.</p><p>The first, &quot;<a href="https://medium.com/@victor_gevers/the-lazy-persons-guide-to-crushing-it-111c184e1c48">The Lazy Person&#39;s Guide to Crushing It!</a>&quot; delves into the fascinating interplay between thinkers and doers, exploring the secret sauce that allows some individuals to accomplish remarkable feats while seemingly exerting minimal effort. I have always been intrigued by this topic, and I was completely immersed in the research and writing process.</p><p>My second article, &quot;<a href="https://medium.com/@victor_gevers/a-technological-leap-in-elderly-care-f1c66c9e5fbb">Elderly Care with using TinyML</a>&quot;, takes a closer look at the revolutionary potential of TinyML. This cutting-edge technology enables machine learning to run directly on devices, empowering them to make autonomous decisions without relying on third-party data sharing. The implications for elderly care are immense, and I was captivated by the possibilities that TinyML offers.</p><p>I&#39;m not going to lie; it&#39;s been a whirlwind of a day. And to think, I&#39;m technically on vacation! I&#39;ve never worked this hard during a supposed break, but I can&#39;t help but feel a sense of excitement and fulfilment. There&#39;s a fire within me, a drive to create and share my thoughts.</p><p>Tomorrow, I&#39;ll catch up on my daily blogs, make progress on my book, and continue my research. It&#39;s daunting, but I&#39;m determined to rise to the challenge. After all, I&#39;m not just a thinker but also a doer. And as I&#39;ve learned from my writing, the secret to achieving great things often lies in embracing both sides of our nature.</p><blockquote>Never give up on your dreams, no matter how painful and difficult your journey is.</blockquote><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=749ae5cd825f" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://blog.victorgevers.com/running-late-749ae5cd825f">Running late</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.victorgevers.com">Victor Gevers</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

My writing hit a wall, my blog was neglected, and my research felt like an insurmountable mountain. It wasn&#39;t pretty. But hey, even Formula One drivers have bad days, right?</p><p>Look, I&#39;m stubborn. Finishing what I start isn&#39;t just about pride; it&#39;s a bit of &quot;I&#39;ll show them!&quot; mixed in. Whether it&#39;s wrangling a sentence into submission or conquering a particularly gruelling workout, I&#39;m not one to wave the white flag.</p><p>Sometimes, the most valuable lessons come from getting lapped. Yesterday&#39;s struggles? They&#39;re just data points. My writing needs a tune-up, or my research requires a new route. Either way, I&#39;m taking notes. Speaking of notes, my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">Zettelkasten system</a> version is getting a workout. I have been working in <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> for weeks, and all that exercise is slowly paying off.</p><p>It&#39;s about more than crossing the finish line first. Sometimes, it&#39;s about enjoying the scenery, even if you&#39;re a few miles behind. I&#39;m learning to appreciate the journey; the pit stops, and the occasional flat tyre. It&#39;s all part of the adventure. If you are interested in my secret sauce, it is <a href="http://Secret Sauce to Getting Things Done">hidden</a> here.</p><h3>Volunteers work</h3><p>The last months have been very busy at the <a href="https://www.divd.nl/">Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure (DIVD)</a>. As part of <a href="https://www.operation-endgame.com/">Operation Endgame</a>, the Dutch Police and Europol infiltrated several botnets, including Smokeloader, cedId, Pikabot, SystemBC, and Bumblebee. During this infiltration, they obtained data about the victims of these botnets. DIVD is providing millions of people with victim notification for civilians. With the <a href="https://csirt.divd.nl/cases/DIVD-2024-00004/">project GLOBAL NGOs</a>, we proactively defend NGOs from the lurking shadows of the digital realm.</p><p>Our team of volunteer cybersecurity enthusiasts tirelessly scan for vulnerabilities, a task as thrilling as watching paint dry but with potentially catastrophic consequences if we miss something. We gently nudge the affected organizations, hoping they&#39;ll heed our warnings.</p><p>Coordinating about 160 volunteers is like organizing a beach party during a sandstorm. During this summer vacation, more than half of them are sporting a lobster-red tan instead of staring at a computer screen. I can&#39;t blame them; recently, it&#39;s been one of our best summers.</p><p>The growth of DIVD, while impressive, has also amplified the challenge. We went from a cosy living room jam session to a full-blown music festival with overflowing porta-potties and questionable food vendors. Our ambitions have grown, but so has the mountain of emails and requests for information, collaboration and meetings (or meetings about meetings, FFS). But also, <em>everyone</em> expects us to be on call 24/7, although we&#39;re still figuring out how to keep the ship going in the direction with some crew on shore leave.</p><p>The workload at my day job has skyrocketed as colleagues gleefully abandon their desks for sunnier shores. This means I have to do some work even during my vacation. This is fine because I love my job. But still, it can be a bit much in combination with my other responsibilities. The months of September until the end of November will be busy. October is already fully booked, thanks to &quot;Cybersecurity Month.&quot;</p><p>Meanwhile, the number of projects and potential unhappy little mistakes keeps piling up. It&#39;s like playing whack-a-mole, except the moles are cyber threats, and the mallet is a half-eaten <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroopwafel"><em>stroopwafel</em></a>. Prioritizing is important, but knowing which fire to put out is hard. Decisions, decisions. Don&#39;t worry. We will manage. :-)</p><p>Even though it&#39;s chaotic, I wouldn&#39;t change this experience for the world. Okay, for a week-long vacation in Cali (Colombia), but that&#39;s not important. We&#39;re making a real impact, fixing one problem at a time. And hey, maybe we&#39;ll even figure out how to convince others that we need more help to finish the job. But if nobody else steps up, you can bet we will. <em>Eventually</em>.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=c50b0db81d4a" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://blog.victorgevers.com/summer-blues-c50b0db81d4a">Summer Blues</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.victorgevers.com">Victor Gevers</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

My thoughts turned to the people affected, especially with the initial tsunami warnings. The epicentre near the Izu Islands and the tremors felt all the way in Tokyo paint a picture of widespread disruption. But I’m relieved to hear that the tsunami warnings were lifted, and there haven’t been reports of major damage or casualties yet. But the lingering threat of aftershocks casts a long shadow, and the constant vigilance required from the authorities is a heavy burden for everyone. This event serves as a stark reminder of the raw power of nature and how vulnerable we are, especially in regions like Japan, situated on the volatile <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Fire">Pacific Ring of Fire</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_tuz1ichttwB4zm5L0xprA.jpeg" /><figcaption><a href="https://www.internetgeography.net/topics/sakurajima-case-study/">https://www.internetgeography.net/topics/sakurajima-case-study/</a></figcaption></figure><p>Last Tuesday, Sakurajima erupted. Images of volcanic lightning illuminated the ash plumes that stretched six kilometres high. It’s a reminder that Sakurajima&#39;s power remains immense even after a quiet spell. The volcano’s history of dramatic eruptions is a constant backdrop to life in the region, and this latest event is a reminder never to become complacent. My thoughts are with everyone there, hoping they stay safe and find strength in their resilience. Local residents are well-informed about the potential dangers and are prepared to evacuate at a moment’s notice.</p><blockquote>The best preparation for tomorrow is doing your best today. — H. Jackson Brown, Jr.</blockquote><h3>Be prepared</h3><p>Life has a knack for throwing curveballs when we least expect them. From flat tyres and sudden illness to unexpected job changes, serious situations or even natural disasters, it’s crucial to have a plan in place to deal with the unexpected. Here are nine practical tips to ensure you’re always prepared, no matter what life throws your way.</p><p><strong>1. Build an Emergency Fund</strong> <br> An emergency fund acts as a financial safety net for those unexpected expenses. Aim to save at least three to six months’ worth of living expenses in a readily accessible account. For example, you can set up an automatic transfer from your checking account to your savings account each month. This ensures you consistently contribute to your emergency fund without having to think about it. Even small, regular contributions can add up over time.</p><p><strong>2. Create a Basic First Aid Kit</strong> <br>A well-stocked first aid kit is invaluable for handling minor injuries and medical emergencies. Ensure it includes essentials like bandages, antiseptic wipes, pain relievers, and any necessary prescription medications.</p><p><strong>3. Develop Essential Skills</strong> <br>Learning basic skills such as CPR, first aid, and even simple car maintenance can equip you to handle emergencies more effectively.</p><p><strong>4. Stay Informed</strong> <br>Keep abreast of weather alerts, local news, and any potential hazards in your area. Being informed allows you to take necessary precautions and stay safe.</p><p><strong>5. Have a Communication Plan</strong> <br>Establish a clear communication plan with family and friends in case of emergencies. Decide on meeting points and ensure everyone has important contact information readily available. Amidst the unpredictability of life, a reliable communication plan serves as an anchor, ensuring connection and coordination when it matters most. It’s the lifeline that pulls loved ones together when the world seems to be falling apart.</p><ul><li><strong>The Out-of-Town Beacon</strong> <br> Select a trusted individual who resides outside your immediate area to serve as the central communication hub. This person can relay messages and updates should local networks fail.</li><li><strong>Sharing the Thread</strong> <br> Ensure that each member of your group possesses a physical and digital list of vital contact numbers, including those of family, friends, neighbours, emergency services, and your designated out-of-town contact.</li><li><strong>Places of Convergence</strong> <br> Agree upon specific meeting points, both in close proximity to your home (perhaps a neighbour’s residence) and further afield (like a community centre or park), in case evacuation or separation occurs.</li><li><strong>Rehearsing the Script</strong> <br>Revise your plan with everyone involved and conduct practice runs under various scenarios. This familiarizes each person with their role and responsibilities in an emergency.</li><li><strong>Beyond the Phone Lines</strong> <br> Explore communication methods beyond traditional phone calls. Text messages, social media platforms, or even two-way radios might prove more reliable if cellular networks become overloaded or unavailable.</li><li><strong>Empowering the Young</strong> <br> Teach children how to contact emergency services and provide their full name and address if necessary.</li><li><strong>Inclusivity in the Plan</strong> <br> If any members of your group have unique communication or mobility needs, these must be integrated into the plan to ensure their safety and well-being.</li></ul><p><strong>6. Maintain Important Documents</strong> <br> Keep copies of crucial documents like passports, insurance policies, and medical records securely. Consider storing digital copies in a cloud-based service for easy access. Additionally:</p><ul><li><strong>Compile essential contact information</strong> <br> Create a physical list of important phone numbers, including emergency services, family, friends, and neighbours. Also, note down the frequencies of local AM/FM radio stations for emergency broadcasts.</li><li><strong>Have physical maps on hand</strong> <br> Keep printed copies of local, regional, and national maps readily available in case GPS or online maps become inaccessible.</li><li><strong>Download offline maps:</strong> <br> Use <a href="https://support.google.com/maps/answer/6291838">Google Maps offline feature</a> to download maps of your area for navigation even without an internet connection.</li><li><strong>Consider offline resources for knowledge:</strong> For extended periods without the internet, consider tools like <a href="https://kiwix.org/en/">Kiwix</a> to access offline versions of Wikipedia and other websites.</li><li><strong>Explore local AI options:</strong> Investigate running a local Large Language Model (LLM) like <a href="https://ollama.com/library/llama3.1">Llama 3.1</a> or <a href="https://ollama.com/library/gemma2">Gemma 2</a> with <a href="https://ollama.com/">Ollama</a> on your computer. This can provide a valuable resource for answering questions and accessing information offline.</li></ul><p>Make sure you’ve got the basics at home, like flashlights, batteries, and a first aid kit. It’s also a good idea to have something to keep things running if the power goes out and a plan for keeping your house safe in crazy weather.</p><p><strong>7. Prepare Your Home</strong> <br> Ensure your home is equipped with essential supplies such as flashlights, batteries, and a first aid kit. Consider having a backup power source for outages and a plan for securing your home during severe weather events.</p><p><strong>8. Pack an Emergency Go-Bag</strong> <br> Have a “just in case” bag packed with important stuff like water, food that doesn’t go bad, some extra clothes, and a first aid kit. That way, you can grab it and go if you ever need to leave your house in a hurry.</p><p><strong>9. Cultivate a Positive Mindset</strong> <br> Keeping a good attitude and being flexible is important when things get tough. Remember, staying strong and not freaking out when things are stressful are great skills to have, no matter what’s going on.</p><p>While we can’t predict everything life throws our way, being prepared equips us to face the unexpected with confidence and resilience. By implementing these tips, you’ll be better equipped to handle life’s challenges and emerge stronger on the other side.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=65dc6734aed9" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://blog.victorgevers.com/shaking-the-status-quo-65dc6734aed9">Shaking the Status Quo</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.victorgevers.com">Victor Gevers</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>
