This results in a loss of diversity and a diminished ability to capture complex and nuanced information. The implications of this research are profound, as it highlights the potential risks of overreliance on AI-generated data for model development.</p><p><strong>Imagine AI models as YouTube content creators.</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/943/1*31xnmzakDyyEyrNn4l9R2w.png" /></figure><p>If these creators only watched and copied videos from other creators who have a similar style, their content would start to look really similar.

Overreliance on AI-generated information can lead to a dangerous echo chamber, stifling innovation and accuracy.”</blockquote><p>As AI technology continues to advance, it is essential to address the challenges posed by model collapse. By understanding the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon, researchers can develop strategies to safeguard the reliability and effectiveness of AI models in the future.</p><p><em>Source: </em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07566-y"><em>AI models collapse when trained on recursively generated data | Nature</em></a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=d6a0b8ae198c" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/everything-about-ai/danger-zone-training-ai-on-ai-generated-data-d6a0b8ae198c">Danger Zone: Training AI on AI-Generated Data</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/everything-about-ai">Everything about AI</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Pioneering Self-Improvement in Language Model Agents</h4><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A team of researchers from Carnegie Mellon University, UC Berkeley, and MultiOn has achieved a groundbreaking advancement in artificial intelligence. Their innovative approach, Recursive IntroSpEction (RISE), marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of large language models (LLMs).</p><p>Traditionally, LLMs have been limited in their ability to learn and adapt from their outputs. RISE seeks to revolutionize this by equipping LLMs with the capacity to analyze their responses over multiple interactions introspectively. This method empowers LLMs to become more autonomous learners, independently identifying and fixing errors.</p><p>The implications of this research are profound. By enabling LLMs to self-improve, researchers have taken a significant step toward developing AI systems that are more intelligent, reliable, and adaptable. The findings, detailed in the paper “Recursive Introspection: Teaching Language Model Agents How to Self-Improve,” promise to usher in a new era of AI where machines can continuously enhance their capabilities through self-reflection and optimization.</p><h3>The Challenge</h3><p>Despite significant advancements, even the most sophisticated LLMs struggle with continuous self-improvement, especially in tasks that require logical reasoning and complex problem-solving. Traditional methods, such as few-shot prompting and fine-tuning on specific datasets, often need to be revised to help these models effectively correct their own errors. Recognizing this critical shortfall, the authors of the study, Yuxiao Qu, Tianjun Zhang, Naman Garg, and Aviral Kumar, have proposed a groundbreaking solution in the form of Recursive IntroSpEction (RISE).</p><h3>The RISE Approach</h3><p>RISE introduces a process that helps AI models get better over time. Imagine you ask an AI a question, and instead of answering just once, the AI tries multiple times, learns from its mistakes, and improves its answers. This is how it works:</p><h4>Starting point</h4><p>The process starts with the AI getting a question or prompt. This is like the first step or the initial state.</p><h4>Multiple attempts</h4><p>The AI tries to answer the question several times. Each time it answers, it gets feedback on whether the answer was right or wrong and what went wrong.</p><h4>Learning from mistakes</h4><p>After each attempt, the AI looks at the feedback and tries to improve the following answer. It’s like doing math homework, correcting your mistakes, and trying to solve the problems again, but supposedly better this time.</p><h4>Repetition and improvement</h4><p>The AI keeps repeating this cycle — trying, getting feedback, and improving. Over multiple rounds, it better understands the question and finds the correct answer.</p><p>RISE combines learning strategies from how humans and animals learn, like reinforcement learning (learning from rewards and punishments) and online imitation learning (learning by watching examples and mimicking them). By combining these strategies, RISE teaches the AI to recognize its mistakes and figure out how to fix them, making the AI smarter and more accurate over time.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6Ygk7HNEBxmx6z8WwUAO3A.png" /></figure><h3>Experimental validation</h3><p>The researchers conducted extensive experiments using LLaMa2, LLaMa3, and Mistral models, focusing on math reasoning tasks. The results showed that RISE significantly enhances the self-improvement capabilities of these models, enabling them to outperform single-turn strategies given an equal amount of computation time. For example, on the GSM8K dataset, RISE improved the performance of LLaMa3–8B by 8.2% and Mistral-7B by 6.6%. These improvements were even more pronounced with LLaMa2–7B and Mistral-7B, with enhancements of 17.7% and 23.9%, respectively, over five turns of introspection.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*VU798CzdbJsqz4cVJoNi6A.png" /></figure><h3>Generalization and robustness</h3><p>An important aspect of RISE is its ability to work well with new types of questions that it wasn’t specifically trained on. The study found that the self-improvement strategy induced by RISE extends to novel, out-of-distribution prompts, thereby showcasing its robustness. This ability to generalize is crucial for real-world applications where models encounter a wide variety of tasks and inputs.</p><h3>The Threat of a Model Collapse</h3><p>While RISE shows great promise, it also introduces potential risks, one of which is “model collapse.” Model collapse happens when an AI system starts to perform worse instead of better because it keeps learning the wrong lessons from its mistakes. Imagine if you kept correcting your homework based on wrong answers — over time, your understanding would get worse, not better. If not carefully managed, RISE could lead to models that, instead of becoming more accurate, become increasingly flawed by reinforcing incorrect information. I have written an <a href="https://medium.com/@victor_gevers/danger-zone-training-ai-on-ai-generated-data-d6a0b8ae198c">article</a> about the groundbreaking study published in Nature that unveiled a critical vulnerability in developing artificial intelligence models when trained on recursively generated data. |</p><p>To prevent model collapse, researchers must carefully monitor the learning process, ensuring that the AI receives the right kind of feedback and doesn’t stray too far from correct answers. This involves setting up robust safeguards and constantly validating the AI’s learning progress.</p><p>This means that AI systems learn and improve by processing information from the actual world. The risks of training AI models primarily on information created by other AI models. This can create a closed loop where AI systems only learn from themselves, leading to the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Echo chamber:</strong> AI models might start repeating the same information without considering new or different perspectives.</li><li><strong>Stifled innovation:</strong> Lack of exposure to new and diverse information can hinder the development of creative and original solutions.</li><li><strong>Reduced accuracy:</strong> Relying solely on AI-generated data can lead to errors and biases going undetected, as the models are learning from imperfect information.</li></ul><h3>Implications and Future Directions</h3><p>Despite the risks, the RISE’s success in enhancing the self-improvement capabilities of LLMs has significant implications for the future of AI. It opens up possibilities for developing more autonomous AI agents capable of continuous learning and adaptation. However, the researchers also acknowledge the need for further iterations and computational resources to refine the approach, primarily when relying solely on self-generated supervision.</p><p>The study suggests that integrating RISE into general instruction-tuning pipelines could provide broader benefits without compromising the models’ initial performance. This integration could pave the way for more sophisticated and capable AI systems that handle increasingly complex and dynamic tasks.</p><h3>My conclusion</h3><p>I would challenge the study’s claims of improved AI performance without drawbacks<strong>.</strong> It relies on limited benchmarks and may overlook potential issues like increased costs and biases. Additionally, the study lacks a long-term perspective. We need more comprehensive testing before we can confidently assess the true impact of this approach and avoid overhyping its benefits. However, the introduction of RISE represents a pivotal advancement in the quest to create more intelligent and autonomous AI agents. This approach addresses a critical limitation in current AI capabilities by enabling LLMs to introspect and improve their responses iteratively. As research continues, RISE holds the potential to transform the landscape of AI, making self-improving models a cornerstone of future AI applications.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=c4ed3bcde87a" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/everything-about-ai/rescursive-introspection-c4ed3bcde87a">Rescursive Introspection</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/everything-about-ai">Everything about AI</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The AI Act and Its Impact on Technology</p><p><em>Day 1</em></p><h3>The AI Act and Its Impact on Technology</h3><p>Today marks a historic moment as the Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) comes into force in Europe. This pioneering framework is set to revolutionize the landscape of AI development, driving innovation that Europeans can trust while providing crucial support to SMEs and startups in the AI sector. As a hacker and cybersecurity expert passionate about technology, I find this development exciting and necessary, despite my usual reluctance to pen down my thoughts due to a perceived lack of writing skills. During my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vgevers/">day job</a> as an innovation manager working for the Dutch government, I identify and evaluate emerging technologies that have the potential to enhance public services while safeguarding national interests (sovereignty), ethical principles, and democratic values.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*UTzAkxjQSA20rW77" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@christianlue?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Christian Lue</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>What is the EU AI Act?</strong></h3><p>The <a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/the-act/">AI Act</a> is the first comprehensive artificial intelligence regulation by a major regulator. This legislation categorizes AI applications into three risk levels:</p><p><strong>Unacceptable Risk<br></strong>Applications posing an unacceptable risk are banned outright. For example, government-run social scoring systems, similar to those used in China, which aggregate personal data to rank citizens, are prohibited. These systems can lead to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/6753f428edfd439ba4b29c71941f52bb">severe discrimination</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/4/18250474/chinese-messages-millions-wechat-qq-yy-data-breach-police">loss of privacy</a>, undermining fundamental human rights.</p><p><strong>High-Risk Applications<br></strong>High-risk applications, such as CV-scanning tools that rank job applicants, are subject to stringent legal requirements. These tools must meet specific criteria to ensure fairness, transparency, and non-discrimination. For instance, an AI system used in <a href="https://therecord.media/ibm-breach-report-cost-rise-to-5-million">medical diagnostics</a> must provide accurate and unbiased results, requiring high-quality training datasets and thorough testing.</p><p><strong>Low-Risk Applications<br></strong>Applications not explicitly banned or listed as high-risk are largely left unregulated. This category includes AI used in customer service chatbots or recommendation systems on streaming services. These tools can operate with minimal oversight, fostering innovation and efficiency.</p><p><strong>Why should you care?<br></strong>AI is deeply embedded in our daily lives. From determining the content you see online to diagnosing and treating diseases, AI’s influence is vast and growing. For example, social media algorithms predict what posts will engage you, while healthcare AI systems assist doctors in identifying cancer. The EU AI Act, akin to the GDPR, has the potential to set a global standard, influencing how AI impacts your life no matter where you live. Countries like Brazil have already taken inspiration from the EU’s regulatory approach, indicating a ripple effect that could shape AI policies worldwide.</p><p><strong>How can organizations apply it?<br></strong>For businesses, especially SMEs and startups, understanding the implications of the AI Act is crucial. The <a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/assessment/eu-ai-act-compliance-checker/">AI Act Compliance Checker</a> is a tool designed to help these organizations determine their legal obligations under the Act. It can also enhance their market reputation as trustworthy AI developers.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*-WbsG2XMDj1cy1Dn" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@chrisbecker?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Chris Becker</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Codes of Practice: A bridge to standards</strong></h3><p>The implementation of the AI Act includes developing Codes of Practice for General Purpose AI model providers. These Codes will act as interim compliance measures until formal standards are adopted. Although not legally binding, adherence to these Codes will be seen as compliance with the AI Act, easing the transition for AI developers.</p><p><strong>Drafting and Enforcing the Codes of Practice<br></strong>The Codes of Practice must be drafted within nine months of the Act’s enforcement to allow time for approval or rejection by the Commission. This process involves collaboration among AI providers, national authorities, civil society, industry, academia, and other stakeholders. The objective is to create a comprehensive set of guidelines that reflect the Act’s intentions regarding health, safety, and fundamental rights.</p><h3><strong>Pros of the AI Act</strong></h3><p><strong>Protection of fundamental Rights<br></strong>The AI Act ensures that AI systems respect fundamental rights, such as privacy, non-discrimination, and human dignity. By banning high-risk applications that pose unacceptable risks, it safeguards citizens from potential abuses of AI technology.</p><p><strong>Transparency and accountability<br></strong>The regulation mandates transparency in AI systems, requiring developers to provide detailed documentation and disclose how AI models are trained. This fosters accountability and helps build public trust in AI technologies. At least that is the point of it.</p><p><strong>Boosting innovation<br></strong>By setting clear rules and guidelines, the AI Act provides a stable regulatory environment that encourages innovation. SMEs and startups can confidently develop new AI solutions, knowing the legal landscape they operate within.</p><p><strong>Global influence<br></strong>Like the GDPR, the AI Act has the potential to become a global benchmark for AI regulation. This could lead to standardized AI policies worldwide, fostering ethical AI development. With a market of 448.4 million consumers, the European Union is poised to significantly influence future AI trends. As consumer awareness grows, demand for safe and reliable products will drive industry standards towards greater accountability and transparency.</p><p><strong>Consumer Trust<br></strong>With stringent regulations ensuring the safety and fairness of AI systems, consumers are more likely to trust and adopt AI technologies, driving market growth.</p><h3><strong>Cons of the AI Act</strong></h3><p><strong>Regulatory Burden<br></strong>Complying with the AI Act can be challenging, especially for small businesses and startups. The costs and complexities of meeting high-risk application requirements may deter innovation and limit market entry for new players.</p><p><strong>Slowed Innovation<br></strong>Stringent requirements for high-risk applications might slow down the pace of AI development. Companies may focus more on compliance than innovation, potentially hindering advancements in the field.</p><p><strong>Competitive Disadvantage<br></strong>European AI companies may find it harder to compete with counterparts in regions with less stringent regulations, such as the US or China. The regulatory burden could put European firms at a disadvantage in the global market.</p><p><strong>Implementation Challenges<br></strong>Developing and enforcing the Codes of Practice within a tight timeline may prove difficult. The complexity of the AI ecosystem and the need for multi-stakeholder collaboration can delay the standardization process.</p><p><strong>Legal Ambiguities<br></strong>The AI Act’s broad categorization of AI applications into risk levels may lead to legal ambiguities. Determining whether a specific AI system falls into a high-risk or low-risk category can be challenging, leading to compliance uncertainties.</p><blockquote>To me the AI Act represents a significant step forward in regulating AI, aligning technological advancements with ethical standards and civic principles. As someone who delves into the intricacies of technology and cybersecurity, I see this regulation as essential. It provides the much-needed guardrails to steer AI development toward prioritizing human rights and safety.</blockquote><blockquote>While there are concerns about overregulation potentially stifling competition with the US, the Act’s emphasis on ethical AI is commendable. It’s a move towards a future where technology serves humanity positively, balancing innovation with accountability.</blockquote><p>If you’ve enjoyed reading it to this point, thank you!</p><p>Please clap, follow, or <a href="https://victorgevers.substack.com/subscribe">subscribe</a> so I can keep you updated with exciting topics.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=fec91ee5029e" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/everything-about-ai/embracing-the-future-of-ai-fec91ee5029e">Embracing the Future of AI</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/everything-about-ai">Everything about AI</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Transforming Everyday Devices with Intelligent Capabilities</p><h3>A Glimpse into the Embedded AI Revolution</h3><p>Consider this ordinary morning: You awaken to a gentle vibration from your wrist. It’s not an alarm but a sophisticated smartwatch that has meticulously tracked your sleep cycles. Through a sleep tracking app, it provides insights into your sleep quality, duration of profound and REM sleep, and even heart rate variability. Armed with this personalized data, you can make informed decisions about your day ahead, opting for an extra hour of rest or a more intense workout.</p><p>As you prepare to start your day, a soft, human-like voice responds to your query about the weather. This isn’t a mere weather report but a dynamic forecast tailored to your location, commute, and even potential outdoor activities, delivered by a voice assistant who understands and responds to your natural language. With a glance, you unlock your smartphone — no cumbersome passwords or fingerprints required. <a href="https://medium.com/@efim.lerner/top-7-tools-face-recognition-engines-2024-01b8bc85330f">Advanced facial recognition technology</a>, powered by embedded AI, swiftly verifies your identity, granting you seamless access to your digital world.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uVZbH8IyYDOpslTXQf7Hkg.jpeg" /></figure><p>Your commute to work is transformed into a serene, productive experience. An <a href="https://www.highstuff.com/self-driving-cars/">autonomous vehicle</a> equipped with an intricate network of sensors, AI algorithms, and technology like <a href="https://www.comma.ai/openpilot">openpilot</a> navigates the complex urban landscape with precision and care. It anticipates traffic conditions, optimizes routes, and even engages in subtle conversations, making your journey efficient and enjoyable.</p><p>This seamless integration of artificial intelligence into our daily lives is the hallmark of the embedded AI revolution. By infusing intelligence into everyday devices, from wearables to automobiles, we’ve ushered in an era of real-time decision-making, personalized experiences, and unprecedented efficiency.</p><p>It’s a future that is no longer a distant dream but a tangible reality, reshaping how we live, work, and interact with the world around us. But when done wrong, it can create a dystopian world. So we must choose wisely and, as consumers, vote with our wallets.</p><h3>Intelligence at the Edge</h3><p>Embedded AI, a subset of artificial intelligence often referred to as on-device AI or <a href="https://www.tinyml.org/">TinyML</a>, represents a paradigm shift in computing.
