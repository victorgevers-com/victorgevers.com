The digital nature of modern solar power systems, with their smart inverters, cloud-based monitoring platforms, and interconnected components, makes them susceptible to cyberattacks. The need to safeguard this critical infrastructure is paramount, ensuring the transition to a sustainable energy future is environmentally, economically sound, secure, and resilient.</p><h4>Enphase</h4><p><a href="https://enphase.com/">Enphase</a> is widely recognized for its microinverters, essential components in solar panel installations. These devices convert the direct current (DC) electricity produced by solar panels into alternating current (AC), making it suitable for household consumption and feeding back into the power grid. The investigation also encompassed the Enphase IQ Gateway devices, pivotal in monitoring and managing solar energy production.</p><p>DIVD researchers <a href="https://www.divd.nl/who-we-are/team/people/wietse-boonstra/">Wietse Boonstra </a>and <a href="https://www.divd.nl/who-we-are/team/people/hidde-smit/">Hidde Smit</a>, working on case <a href="https://csirt.divd.nl/DIVD-2024-00011">DIVD-2024–00011</a>, have uncovered six new zero-day vulnerabilities in Enphase IQ Gateway devices. They collaborated with the vendor to disclose these vulnerabilities. The discovery of these vulnerabilities underscores the potential risks associated with the widespread adoption of internet-connected devices in the renewable energy sector.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*swyx1_xnXj1Lndmp" /></figure><p>The first three vulnerabilities allow unauthenticated attackers to gain complete control over the Enphase IQ Gateway and any connected devices. However, this vulnerability only exists if your Enphase equipment is connected to an untrusted network, such as the public internet or a home guest network. The manufacturer, Enphase, has stated that approximately four million of their systems are currently deployed in over 150 countries. Their actions prevented what could have been a catastrophic cyberattack.</p><h3>Solarman</h3><h4>2022</h4><p>In 2022, DIVD researcher <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jelle-ursem-2393b9188/">Jelle Ursem</a> made a concerning discovery: a publicly accessible GitHub repository containing the login credentials for <a href="https://www.solarmanpv.com/">SolarMan</a>’s Super Admin account. This oversight could have had catastrophic consequences, potentially granting cybercriminals the ability to control and manipulate nearly one million solar panel inverters worldwide. Fortunately, this potential crisis was averted through responsible disclosure practices, and no malicious actions were taken.</p><h4>2024</h4><p>Finally, in a development that underscores the escalating cyber threats facing the renewable energy sector, a <a href="https://blogapp.bitdefender.com/labs/content/files/2024/08/Bitdefender-PReport-solarman-creat7907.pdf?_gl=1*ftm67n*_ga*MTA5NDU1Mzg4Mi4xNzIzMzI1NTQw*_ga_6M0GWNLLWF*MTcyMzMyNTUzOC4xLjEuMTcyMzMyNjI0NC42LjAuOTkzMTA5NjU3">report</a> released by Bitdefender on Wednesday, August 7th, brought to light a series of vulnerabilities discovered within solar farms located across the United States. These vulnerabilities, if exploited, could have devastating consequences, potentially granting malicious actors the capability to disrupt power generation, manipulate energy distribution, and even inflict physical damage on critical infrastructure. However, Bitdefender’s analysis revealed multiple vulnerabilities in the cloud APIs that connect users with their solar hardware. These vulnerabilities, if exploited, could have allowed unauthorized attackers to gain control over the inverters, effectively enabling them to manipulate the energy output of solar systems across the globe.</p><p>They found the Solarman platform’s API, specifically the <strong>/oauth2-s/oauth/token</strong> endpoint, particularly vulnerable. This flaw could have allowed malicious actors to generate authorization tokens for any account on the platform, allowing them to control the inverters’ settings remotely. Such control would enable attackers to alter how these inverters interact with the grid, potentially destabilizing it by forcing too much or too little power into the network.</p><p>Beyond the ability to control inverter settings, the vulnerabilities also exposed significant personal and operational data. The API endpoints on Solarman and Deye’s platforms leaked excessive information, including GPS coordinates of solar installations, real-time energy production data, and even personally identifiable user information.</p><p>The security flaws were present in various aspects of the platforms, offering attackers multiple ways to exploit the systems. For instance, Deye’s platform was found to use a hardcoded account with a simple password (“<strong>123456</strong>”), which could be used to access devices and sensitive information. This kind of oversight in security practices highlights the need for more robust cybersecurity measures in the solar power industry.</p><h4>What do we learn from this?</h4><p>Despite solar power&#39;s benefits, the infrastructure supporting it is not immune to risks. The increasing reliance on digital systems to manage and control solar power installations introduces several vulnerabilities, particularly in cybersecurity. The interconnected nature of solar power systems creates a systemic vulnerability. A weakness in one component, such as a microinverter or data logger, can have a domino effect, compromising the entire system. The globalized nature of the solar power industry adds another layer of complexity. Components are often sourced from various countries, creating potential supply chain vulnerabilities, especially when critical components are manufactured in countries with different regulatory standards or geopolitical interests.</p><p>While offering numerous benefits, the increasing digitization of solar power systems amplifies the potential risks associated with cyberattacks. As solar energy becomes a more significant component of national energy grids, the importance of cybersecurity in this sector cannot be overstated.</p><p>The risks associated with these vulnerabilities are not just theoretical for individuals and businesses. The consequences of a successful cyberattack on solar power systems could be devastating, leading to widespread power outages, financial losses, and even threats to national security. As such, there is a pressing need for more robust cybersecurity measures to protect these critical systems.</p><p>Governments and regulatory bodies must also play a more active role in ensuring the security of solar power infrastructure. This includes implementing stricter regulations on the manufacturing and management of solar power systems, particularly concerning cybersecurity. The Cyber Resilience Act and the NIS2 directive, which targets critical infrastructure systems, are steps in the right direction. These regulations aim to hold software developers accountable and ensure that the systems they create are secure and resilient against cyber threats.</p><p>Moreover, greater transparency and accountability in the supply chain are needed, mainly when dealing with foreign companies. For example, the involvement of Chinese companies in producing solar power equipment should be closely scrutinized to ensure that these components do not pose a security risk.</p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>Solar power is undeniably a critical component of the global energy transition. Its benefits, including sustainability, affordability, and energy security, make it a key player in the fight against climate change and pursuing a greener future.
